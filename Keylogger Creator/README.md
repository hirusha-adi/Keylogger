# What is this?
`maker.py` will create you a new file (`keylogger.py`) after asking for the relevant informaion (SEND_EMAIL_ADDRESS, SEND_EMAIL_PASSWORD, RECIEVE_EMAIL). This will also help you by installing the required modules + compiling the final `keylogger.exe` for you. You can rename it to anyname you would like and shre it with anyone! (The installing modules + compiling part is optional and you must have an installation of `Python3.6` or above)
